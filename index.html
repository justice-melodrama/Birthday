    <h1>Birthday Fundraiser</h1>
    <p>Family, friends, good people of the world, </p>
    <p>For my 36th birthday, I‚Äôm raising funds for ELSC, an organization doing vital work defending the rights of Palestine activists across Europe. 
        Instead of gifts, please consider donating to this fundraiser and supporting their important efforts.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.5em; color: green; font-weight: bold;"> I will match your donations! </p>
     <p style="font-size: 1em; font-weight: bold;"> I will also submit them to my employer charity program which will match my donations x2!!
        If you are in Amsterdam or around, please join me on Sunday the 15th of June for some birthday celebrations (time and location TBD, probably somewhere outdoors in the early afternoon).
        If you are not in Amsterdam, I send you my heartfelt greetings and next time we meet, let‚Äôs have a drink on me!
        </p>

<p>I had hoped to focus on a different cause this year‚Äîperhaps something like wildlife conservation. But, just as I did last year, I find myself fundraising for ELSC again. I had wished for things to improve, or at least to head in a more hopeful direction. Sadly, we‚Äôre still witnessing immense suffering.</p>

<p>At this stage, it‚Äôs not only about resistance. It‚Äôs also about bearing witness, ensuring that voices are heard, and that the truth is recorded. While we may not be able to stop the violence, we can still speak out and stand in solidarity. Many remain silent out of fear‚Äîbut some are bravely raising their voices, despite serious personal risks. Those who protest the genocide in Gaza are facing consequences like job loss, revoked visas, and threats to their residency. ELSC provides crucial legal support to these activists and has a strong record of success in their work all across Europe.</p> 

<p>You can find out more about their work here. Any contribution, no matter the size, makes a difference. You can send your gift using the options at the bottom. </p>

<p>Thank you for your support. Lots of love and Free Palestine üçâ</p>
